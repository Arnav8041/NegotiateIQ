# 🎯 NegotiateIQ

**Your real-time AI negotiation coach.**

NegotiateIQ listens to your live negotiations and shows you tactical coaching cards on screen — like having a negotiation expert passing you notes during a high-stakes conversation.

> Built for the **Gemini Live Agent Challenge** hackathon · Powered by Gemini Live API on Google Cloud

## What It Does

1. You open the app and describe your situation (e.g. "My landlord wants to raise rent from $1,400 to $1,650")
2. You start your negotiation — phone call, video call, in-person — with the app open nearby
3. The app listens via your device mic and shows coaching cards in real-time:
   - 🎯 **Counter-moves** — what to say next
   - ⚠️ **Tactic alerts** — when the other party uses anchoring, false deadlines, etc.
   - 📊 **Market data** — rent comps, salary benchmarks pulled live
   - 🤫 **Silence cues** — when to stop talking and let silence work for you
   - ✅ **Reinforcement** — when you're doing great
4. After the conversation: a full recap with tactics detected, offers tracked, and next steps
